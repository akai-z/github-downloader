# Github Downloader

Github Downloader is a shell tool that allows to download Github repositories  
sources without needing to install [git](https://github.com/git/git) and cloning.

Instead, it uses [Github API](https://developer.github.com/v3/) to do that.

The tool could be useful in Docker images, where installing git might not be needed.
